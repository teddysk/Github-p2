    <p> To understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. <br> Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds—the same person who created Linux. <br> Git is similar to other version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few. <br><br> 

        So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When developers <br> create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and <br> after the first official (non-beta) release.<br><br>

        Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the <br> modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, <br> as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. <br> Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.</p>
